<h2>Login Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>The following messages are common errors you may encounter when trying to log into one of the online applications (e.g. the Intranet, Atlas, etc.).  In some cases, Chicago Staff and Center Staff must deal with the same problem in different ways; please read the instructions carefully and follow the steps that apply to your position.</p>





<p><span class="error-description">Error:  You have entered an incorrect password.</span>  This message indicates that the password you entered does not match up with the username you provided.  Note that the password is sensitive to capitalization (e.g. "Password" is different than "password").  If you have tried to enter your password several times and you still cannot get in:</p>

<p class="p-user-type"><span class="user-type">IES Abroad Students:</span>  Please contact your local center student support staff for assistance.</p>

<p class="p-user-type"><span class="user-type">IES Abroad Staff:</span>  Please contact the Chicago helpdesk (https://helpdesk.iesabroad.org) for additional login/password support needs. If you do not have a login/password, please contact your Dean.</p>





<p><span class="error-description">You must change your password before you can enter this website.</span>  This message indicates that your password has expired or that it has been reset.  It will appear the first time you try to log into the intranet or another online application, and it may appear periodically after that (you are required to change your password at least once every 45 days). Whenever this message appears, you must:</p>
<ol>
    <li>re-enter your password,</li>

    <li>check the "Change Password" checkbox,</li>

    <li>enter a new password that is different than your old password</li>

    <li>enter that new password again for confirmation, and</li>

    <li>press "Login"</li>
</ol>




<p><span class="error-description">Error:  Username not valid.</span>  This message indicates that the username you entered does not exist.  Double check your username.  If you think that what you entered is correct:</p>

<p><span class="error-description">Error:  Your username is marked as 'inactive' in the security system. </span>  Ask your supervisor to update this.</span>  This message indicates that your profile has been 'turned off' in the security system - usually because there was a period of time when you were not employed by IES or did not need access to the online applications.  Your supervisor must contact Human Resources to 'activate' your profile.  (IES Faculty and Casual Staff profiles will be activated by the Center's Dean.)</p>





<p><span class="error-description">HTTP Status 403 - Access to the requested resource has been denied </span> You don't have access to the application you're trying to log into.  You did enter in a correct password.</p>
